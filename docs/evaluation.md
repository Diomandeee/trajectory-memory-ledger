# Evaluation

Trajectory Memory Ledger currently has four levels of measured evidence plus one
prepared external proof gate:

1. Artifact correctness: the Rust runtime builds, passes tests, passes clippy, performs one-shot ingestion, normalizes schema-v2 records, scores trajectories, handles `(date, seq)` cursor rollover, and appends under a file lock.
2. Corpus and reward evidence: the originating deployment corpus contains 7,468 scored trajectories, 67,409 observed tool events, 73,470 recovered tool steps, and 3,678 exported ChatML examples. Reward-selected trajectories are substantially stronger than a deterministic random control on the current selection metric.
3. Held-out coding-agent model-quality evidence: the repository now includes a real KARL V7 benchmark over 10 models and 5 held-out coding-agent session contexts. It measures scored response quality, not executed task completion.
4. Executed downstream task completion: the executable benchmark runner now has a checked synthetic smoke report, real prompt-conditioned model-output reports, Gemma 4 E2B/12B QAT base-model sanity reports, two real adapter-conditioned reports over a six-task held-out Python stdlib task set, and a 60-task repair-router/planner gate. The first Gemma 3 1B/256-token adapter lane was negative at 0/6 for every condition. The stronger Gemma 4 E2B/512-row/4096-token adapter lane is positive for reward-selected data on the six-task gate, but the 60-task replication falsifies the broad adapter claim for the current E2B recipe. The strongest checked downstream result is now router/planner-level: a public-only anticipatory repair planner reaches 60/60 on `python-stdlib-heldout-v1-60`, with `synthetic_rows=0`, `read_hidden_task_specs=false`, `hidden_tests_sent_to_model=false`, and zero regressions against both the 57/60 E4B overlay and the E2B base.
5. Prepared real-repo issue-resolution gate: `scripts/prepare_real_repo_issue_gate.py` validates same-instance SWE-bench-style prediction files, parses official harness reports when present, compares base agent versus base+TML planner, and refuses a performance claim for missing reports or synthetic fixtures. `scripts/fetch_swebench_verified_mini_manifest.py` freezes a public-safe 50-row Verified Mini manifest, `scripts/preflight_real_repo_issue_gate_env.py` records local harness readiness, and `scripts/generate_real_repo_issue_predictions.py` controls same-command base/planner prediction generation. The checked fixture, manifest, local preflight, dry-run, repo-prep smoke, and one-instance Codex prediction smoke prove guardrails and patch generation only; TML has not yet proven real-repo/SWE-bench issue-resolution lift.

## Daemon Benchmark

Run:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin daemon-bench -- \
  --flows 1000 \
  --steps 3 \
  --concurrent-writers 8 \
  --records-per-writer 100 \
  --output benchmarks/daemon-benchmark-2026-06-03.json
```

Environment for the checked-in result:

| Field | Value |
|---|---:|
| Platform | Apple M4 |
| OS | macOS 15.6.1 |
| Rust | rustc 1.95.0 |
| Cargo | cargo 1.95.0 |

Checked-in result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Workload | 1,000 flows, 3 steps/flow |
| Event envelopes | 8,000 |
| Ingest time | 6.287 s |
| Events/sec | 1,272.385 |
| Cards/sec | 159.048 |
| Append latency mean | 3.627 ms |
| Append latency p95 | 4.027 ms |
| Duplicate reprocess skip | 1,000 duplicate cards skipped |
| Cursor rollover | Passed |
| Concurrent append | 800/800 records, 800 unique IDs |

The benchmark uses synthetic gateway events. It measures daemon throughput, duplicate handling, date-scoped cursor behavior, and concurrent JSONL append safety. It does not measure downstream model improvement.

## Reward Selection Evidence

The normalized private deployment corpus is not included in this public repository, but its aggregate statistics are:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Scored trajectories | 7,468 |
| Observed tool events | 67,409 |
| Recovered tool steps | 73,470 |
| Exported ChatML examples | 3,678 |
| Train / validation split | 3,310 / 368 |
| Top-35 vs random reward Cohen's d | 2.7159 |
| Top-35 vs random advantage Cohen's d | 2.7917 |

The strongest leave-one-out ablation signal is verification. Removing verification changes the ranking most sharply, which supports the design choice to reward tested and inspected edits over unverified mutation.

This is evidence that the reward function selects cleaner training examples than random sampling. It is not, by itself, evidence that a trained model completes more tasks.

## Agent Evaluation Harness

`agent-eval` aggregates evaluated tool-plan generations by experimental condition.

Expected input format:

```json
{"condition":"reward_selected","task_id":"task_001","generated_tools":["Read","Edit","Bash"],"task_passed":true,"tests_included":true,"build_included":true,"reward_score":0.74}
```

Run the synthetic example:

```bash
cargo run --bin agent-eval -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/tool-plan-generations.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/agent-eval-example-2026-06-03.json
```

The checked-in example contains synthetic rows only. It verifies the harness shape and output metrics; it should not be cited as model performance evidence.

## Held-Out Coding-Agent Model Benchmark

`heldout-agent-bench` aggregates real held-out coding-agent benchmark score rows. The checked-in fixture is a privacy-preserving aggregate conversion of the KARL V7 model benchmark generated on `2026-04-02` by `~/Desktop/karl/karl/v7/model_benchmark.py`.

Run:

```bash
cargo run --bin heldout-agent-bench -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/karl-v7-heldout-coding-agent-model-scores.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/karl-v7-heldout-agent-benchmark-2026-04-02.json
```

Protocol:

| Field | Value |
|---|---:|
| Benchmark kind | `karl-v7-heldout-coding-agent-model-quality` |
| Task set | `karl-v7-5-session-contexts` |
| Conditions | 10 model backends |
| Held-out contexts | 5 per model, 50 total scored contexts |
| Score metric | `karl.v7.style_validator.overall` |
| Quality pass threshold | 0.4 |
| Raw generations included | No |
| Executed task completion measured | No |

Checked-in result:

| Condition | Model id | Contexts | Quality pass | Mean score | Mean latency |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GPT-5.4-mini | `gpt-5.4-mini` | 5 | 100% | 1.0000 | 1.5688s |
| GPT-OSS 120B | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | 5 | 100% | 1.0000 | 5.5191s |
| MiniMax M2.5 | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` | 5 | 100% | 1.0000 | 7.0485s |
| DeepSeek R1 | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528` | 5 | 100% | 1.0000 | 10.4395s |
| DeepSeek V3.1 | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1` | 5 | 100% | 0.9850 | 2.7698s |
| GLM 4.7 | `zai-org/GLM-4.7` | 5 | 100% | 0.9850 | 5.5894s |
| GPT-OSS 20B | `openai/gpt-oss-20b` | 5 | 100% | 0.9840 | 4.4039s |
| GLM-5 | `zai-org/GLM-5` | 5 | 80% | 0.8000 | 16.5684s |
| Kimi K2.5 | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` | 5 | 40% | 0.3850 | 21.2216s |
| Qwen3.5 397B | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B` | 5 | 0% | 0.0000 | 25.4496s |

The aggregate report selects `GPT-5.4-mini` as `best_condition_by_mean_score` because four models tied at mean score 1.0000 and `GPT-5.4-mini` had the lowest mean latency among the tied models.

This is real held-out model-quality evidence over coding-agent contexts. It is not evidence that the ledger's reward-selected trajectories improve executed coding-task success, because the benchmark does not run tests in target repositories and does not compare random versus reward-selected training data on the same executable task set.

## Executable Task Benchmark Runner

`materialize-executable-bench` and `executable-task-bench` are the execution gate for downstream task-completion evidence. The materializer joins canonical task specs with condition-specific candidate/model-output rows. The executor then materializes each joined row into an isolated temp workspace, writes setup files and candidate files, runs a verifier command with a timeout, and aggregates pass/fail by condition.

Run the checked smoke suite:

```bash
cargo run --bin materialize-executable-bench -- \
  --tasks examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-smoke.jsonl \
  --candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-smoke.jsonl \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-task-smoke.jsonl

cargo run --bin executable-task-bench -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/executable-task-smoke.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/executable-task-smoke-2026-06-06.json
```

Task spec row shape:

```json
{
  "task_id": "py_add_ints",
  "setup_files": {"tests/test_math_tools.py": "..."},
  "verifier_command": "python3 -m unittest discover -s tests",
  "timeout_ms": 5000,
  "benchmark_kind": "executable-task-bench-smoke",
  "task_set": "python-stdlib-smoke-v0"
}
```

Candidate row shape:

```json
{
  "condition": "reward_selected",
  "task_id": "py_add_ints",
  "candidate_files": {"src/math_tools.py": "..."},
  "generated_tools": ["Read", "Edit", "Bash"],
  "tests_included": true,
  "source_artifact": "model-output-run.jsonl",
  "synthetic": true
}
```

Safety and reproducibility properties:

| Property | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Workspace isolation | Each row runs in a fresh temp directory |
| Path safety | Absolute paths, parent directories, and non-normal path components are rejected |
| Timeout | Hung verifier commands are killed and reported as timeouts |
| Evidence | Report includes exit code, timeout flag, duration, stdout/stderr previews, and failed task ids |
| Task/candidate split | Held-out test fixtures are stored once, separate from model candidate files |
| Synthetic marking | Input rows can be marked `synthetic`; the checked smoke fixture marks every row synthetic |

Checked smoke result:

| Condition | Tasks | Passed | Pass rate | Failed task ids |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `reward_selected` | 3 | 3 | 100% | none |
| `full_ledger` | 3 | 2 | 66.67% | `py_unique_sorted` |
| `random` | 3 | 0 | 0% | `py_add_ints`, `py_slugify`, `py_unique_sorted` |

This report proves the executable benchmark path works: verifier commands run, failing candidates fail, passing candidates pass, and aggregation is condition-aware. It is intentionally not downstream model-lift evidence because all 9 checked rows are synthetic smoke rows.

## Real Model-Output Executable Benchmark

The first non-synthetic executable benchmark uses the held-out task set in `examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl` and public task prompts in `examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl`. Public prompts were sent to real model CLIs with trajectory context built from the private KARL trajectory store. Hidden verifier tests were not included in the prompts.

Candidate generation:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_executable_candidates_cli.py \
  --public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --trajectory-store "$KARL_TRAJECTORY_STORE" \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-claude-sonnet-karl-context-2026-06-07.jsonl \
  --raw-dir /tmp/tml-real-model-output-2026-06-07 \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-claude-sonnet-2026-06-07.json \
  --backend claude \
  --model sonnet \
  --max-budget-usd 2.00
```

Materialization and execution:

```bash
cargo run --bin materialize-executable-bench -- \
  --tasks examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-claude-sonnet-karl-context-2026-06-07.jsonl \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-task-claude-sonnet-karl-context-2026-06-07.jsonl

cargo run --bin executable-task-bench -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/executable-task-claude-sonnet-karl-context-2026-06-07.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/executable-task-claude-sonnet-karl-context-2026-06-07.json \
  --require-real
```

The same protocol was run for `gemini-2.5-flash`. Both reports have `synthetic_rows=0` and `measures_executed_task_completion=true`.

Held-out task set:

| Task id | Target behavior |
|---|---|
| `py_parse_duration` | Parse h/m/s duration strings into seconds and reject malformed input |
| `py_merge_intervals` | Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals |
| `py_topological_sort` | Deterministic topological sort with cycle rejection |
| `py_group_by_key` | Group dictionaries by key while preserving order and missing-key behavior |
| `py_chunked` | Chunk list or generator input into tuples |
| `py_redact_secrets` | Redact obvious API keys, bearer tokens, and password assignments |

Real executable result:

| Backend | Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Failed task ids |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Claude Sonnet | `random` | 6 | 6 | 100% | none |
| Claude Sonnet | `reward_selected` | 6 | 6 | 100% | none |
| Claude Sonnet | `full_ledger` | 6 | 6 | 100% | none |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | `random` | 6 | 5 | 83.33% | `py_parse_duration` |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | `reward_selected` | 6 | 5 | 83.33% | `py_chunked` |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | `full_ledger` | 6 | 4 | 66.67% | `py_parse_duration`, `py_chunked` |

Interpretation:

- This is real executable task-completion evidence because generated candidate files were run against hidden verifier tests in isolated workspaces.
- Claude Sonnet saturated this six-task benchmark, so it provides no condition separation.
- Gemini 2.5 Flash produced a discriminative result: `reward_selected` tied `random` at 5/6 and exceeded `full_ledger` at 4/6.
- This does not prove that reward-selected trajectory training improves task completion over random selection. It proves a real prompt-conditioned executable evaluation path and shows that the current v0 task set is too small/easy to establish reward-selected lift over random.

## Training-Lift Adapter Experiment

The next empirical gate was a trained or adapter-conditioned executable held-out coding-agent evaluation with the same task set across three ledger-data conditions:

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| `random` | Training examples sampled randomly from eligible trajectories |
| `reward_selected` | Training examples selected by positive domain advantage |
| `full_ledger` | Full normalized export, filtered for train/eval leakage |

The repository includes a preflight script for preparing the controlled private splits:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_training_lift_experiment.py \
  --trajectory-store "$KARL_TRAJECTORY_STORE" \
  --heldout-public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --heldout-task-specs examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --output-dir output/private-training-lift-2026-06-08 \
  --report benchmarks/training-lift-preflight-2026-06-08.json \
  --sample-size 96 \
  --probe-remote \
  --remote-host mac5
```

The script writes private train/validation JSONL files under ignored `output/private-*` paths and writes only aggregate hashes/statistics to the checked report. The initial `2026-06-08` remote preflight had status `blocked_remote_training_unreachable`; a second local preflight recorded a Mac5-free fallback with status `ready_for_local_adapter_training`.

| Condition | Selected records | Train | Validation | Mean reward | Mean advantage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `random` | 96 | 86 | 10 | 0.6750 | 0.7333 |
| `reward_selected` | 96 | 86 | 10 | 0.7408 | 1.6182 |
| `full_ledger` | 96 | 86 | 10 | 0.6787 | 0.8774 |

Additional preflight facts:

| Field | Value |
|---|---:|
| Eligible private records after filters | 2,920 |
| Held-out leakage-risk exclusions | 2,138 |
| Missing prompt exclusions | 749 |
| Too-few-tool exclusions | 1,663 |
| Remote trainer probe | `mac5` SSH failed with timeout |

The local fallback preflight was run as:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_training_lift_experiment.py \
  --trajectory-store "$KARL_TRAJECTORY_STORE" \
  --heldout-public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --heldout-task-specs examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --output-dir output/private-training-lift-2026-06-08 \
  --report benchmarks/training-lift-local-preflight-2026-06-08.json \
  --sample-size 96 \
  --probe-local
```

Local preflight result:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `ready_for_local_adapter_training` |
| Python | `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin/python3.14` |
| MLX plain import | Fails with duplicate OpenMP runtime |
| MLX workaround import | Passes with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` |
| `mlx_lm` help check | Passes |
| Memory | 16.0 GB |
| Free disk | 6.97 GB |

This meant the adapter experiment could proceed without Mac5 if needed, but Mac5 later became reachable and was used for the checked adapter run.

Mac5 later became reachable, so the three adapters were trained there using `mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-4bit`. Adapter weights, raw training rows, and raw generation logs remain under ignored private output directories and are not checked in.

Training settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---:|
| Iterations | 500 |
| Batch size | 1 |
| LoRA layers | 4 |
| Max sequence length | 256 |
| Learning rate | 1e-5 |
| Validation rows per condition | 10 |

Checked adapter-training result:

| Condition | Final train loss | Final validation loss | Validation rank |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `reward_selected` | 1.129 | 1.484 | 1 |
| `full_ledger` | 0.973 | 1.843 | 2 |
| `random` | 0.918 | 2.031 | 3 |

The reward-selected adapter reduced validation loss by 26.93% relative to `random`; `full_ledger` reduced validation loss by 9.26% relative to `random`. This is training-objective evidence only. It does not establish downstream task-completion lift.

Candidate generation from the trained adapters used only the public prompts:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_executable_candidates_mlx_adapter.py \
  --public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --model mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-4bit \
  --adapter-root output/private-adapters-gemma3-1b-2026-06-10 \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma3-1b-adapters-mac5-clean-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --raw-dir output/private-generation-raw-gemma3-1b-clean-2026-06-10 \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-mlx-gemma3-1b-adapters-mac5-clean-2026-06-10.json \
  --max-tokens 1024 \
  --timeout-s 360 \
  --seed 42
```

The generated candidate report has `synthetic_rows=0` and `hidden_tests_sent_to_model=false`.

Materialization and execution:

```bash
cargo run --bin materialize-executable-bench -- \
  --tasks examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma3-1b-adapters-mac5-clean-2026-06-10.jsonl \

cargo run --bin executable-task-bench -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/executable-task-mlx-gemma3-1b-adapters-mac5-clean-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/executable-task-mlx-gemma3-1b-adapters-mac5-clean-2026-06-10.json \
  --require-real
```

Checked adapter-conditioned executable result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Failed task ids |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `random` | 6 | 0 | 0% | all six tasks |
| `reward_selected` | 6 | 0 | 0% | all six tasks |
| `full_ledger` | 6 | 0 | 0% | all six tasks |

Interpretation:

- The training-lift gate was executed end-to-end: private splits, three adapters, public-prompt candidate generation, hidden-test materialization, and `--require-real` executable scoring.
- The reward-selected split produced the best validation loss, which supports the claim that the reward-selected data better matches the private validation objective.
- The downstream executable benchmark is negative. It does not prove that reward-selected trajectory training improves task completion over random selection.
- The next empirical gate should use a stronger base model or more capable training recipe and a larger/harder executable task set before making a downstream-lift claim.

### Gemma 4 Base-Model Sanity Gate

The first local adapter result was all-zero, but that did not isolate the cause. It combined a very small base model, a small private split, 256-token training context, and limited generation behavior. Stronger base-model sanity runs were added so the repository can distinguish "the benchmark is impossible" from "the previous training recipe was too weak."

Candidate generation used `mlx-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-4bit` and `mlx-community/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-4bit` through `mlx-vlm` on Mac5. The script loads the MLX-VLM model once, applies the instruct chat template, sends only public task prompts and starter files, records raw generations outside the public candidate JSONL, and writes a report with `hidden_tests_sent_to_model=false`.

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_executable_candidates_mlx_vlm.py \
  --public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --model-path ~/Desktop/tml-gemma4-models/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-4bit \
  --model-label mlx-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-4bit \
  --condition gemma4_e2b_qat_base \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --raw-dir output/private-generation-raw-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-2026-06-10 \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-mac5-2026-06-10.json \
  --max-tokens 2048 \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --repair-attempts 2
```

Generation report:

| Field | Value |
|---|---:|
| Model | `mlx-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-4bit` |
| Backend | `mlx_vlm.generate` |
| Public tasks | 6 |
| Synthetic rows | 0 |
| Hidden tests sent to model | false |
| Max generation tokens | 2048 |
| Public compatibility failures before hidden tests | 0/6 |

The 12B run used the same protocol with `mlx-community/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-4bit`, `max_tokens=4096`, `synthetic_rows=0`, and `hidden_tests_sent_to_model=false`. It loaded successfully on Mac5. One public compatibility failure remained before hidden-test materialization: `py_redact_secrets` produced malformed Python even after two public-only repair attempts.

Materialization and execution:

```bash
cargo run --bin materialize-executable-bench -- \
  --tasks examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v0.jsonl \
  --candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-task-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl

  --output benchmarks/executable-task-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-mac5-2026-06-10.json \
  --require-real
```

Checked base-model executable result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Failed task ids |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `gemma4_e2b_qat_base` | 6 | 3 | 50.0% | `py_topological_sort`, `py_chunked`, `py_redact_secrets` |
| `gemma4_12b_qat_base` | 6 | 5 | 83.33% | `py_redact_secrets` |

Interpretation:

- The old all-zero local result should not be read as proof that the ledger idea failed. It was a negative result for the specific Gemma 3 1B adapter setup.
- The Gemma 4 E2B QAT base model reaches 3/6 on the same hidden-test executable task set without ledger fine-tuning.
- The Gemma 4 12B QAT base model reaches 5/6 on the same task set, confirming that Mac5 can run a materially stronger local baseline.
- The remaining 12B failure is a malformed redaction implementation, not a benchmark/system crash. It points toward a public-only repair/checking layer, not hidden-test leakage.
- The next controlled lift experiment should start from Gemma 4 12B-class or stronger models, train with at least 4096-token context, use hundreds or thousands of rows per condition, and report both base-model and adapter-conditioned executable deltas.

### Gemma 4 E2B 512-Row Adapter Lift Gate

The stronger adapter lane reuses the same private trajectory pool but increases the training scale and context length: 512 selected records per condition, 460 train rows and 52 validation rows, 4096-token training context, 500 MLX LoRA iterations, and raw-Python public-only candidate generation. Raw private rows, adapters, and raw generation logs remain under ignored `output/private-*` paths. The public-safe aggregate training report is `benchmarks/training-lift-adapter-training-mlx-gemma4-e2b-512x4096-mac5-2026-06-10.json`.

Training settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---:|
| Base model | `mlx-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-4bit` |
| Rows per condition | 512 |
| Train / validation rows | 460 / 52 |
| Iterations | 500 |
| Batch size | 1 |
| LoRA layers | 4 |
| Max sequence length | 4096 |
| Learning rate | 1e-5 |
| Gradient checkpointing | true |

Aggregate training result:

| `random` | 0.6782 | 0.8051 | 1.066 | 1.089 |
| `reward_selected` | 0.7259 | 1.6717 | 0.963 | 1.277 |
| `full_ledger` | 0.6790 | 0.8333 | 0.846 | 0.354 |

The validation objective does not rank the conditions the same way as the hidden executable task result, so downstream completion must be measured directly.

Candidate generation used `scripts/generate_executable_candidates_mlx_adapter.py` with `--prompt-format raw-python`, `--max-tokens 1024`, and one public-only repair attempt. Hidden tests were not sent to the model. The checked generation report is `benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-mlx-gemma4-e2b-adapters-512x4096-rawpython-mac5-2026-06-10.json`.

Checked adapter-conditioned executable result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Failed task ids |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `random` | 6 | 3 | 50.00% | `py_parse_duration`, `py_chunked`, `py_redact_secrets` |
| `reward_selected` | 6 | 5 | 83.33% | `py_chunked` |
| `full_ledger` | 6 | 2 | 33.33% | `py_parse_duration`, `py_topological_sort`, `py_group_by_key`, `py_chunked` |

Interpretation:

- This is the first positive downstream adapter lift signal in the repository: `reward_selected` beats `random` by two tasks and 33.33 percentage points on the same hidden executable gate.
- The result has `synthetic_rows=0` and records `hidden_tests_sent_to_model=false`.
- The old all-zero adapter result is now correctly scoped to the Gemma 3 1B/256-token recipe.
- The task set has only six tasks, so this is not yet a broad SWE-style performance proof. The next gate should replicate the lift on E4B or a 12B-class cloud training run and a larger 50-100 task executable set.

### Larger 60-Task Replication Gate

The six-task lift signal was followed by a larger Python stdlib held-out suite, `python-stdlib-heldout-v1-60`. The suite has 60 public prompts, 60 hidden-test executable specs, and an oracle candidate file. The oracle report passed all tasks, so the suite itself is internally consistent.

Run shape:

```bash
cargo run --bin executable-task-bench -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/executable-task-oracle-python-stdlib-heldout-v1.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/executable-task-oracle-python-stdlib-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.json \
  --require-real
```

Gemma 4 E2B QAT base, E4B QAT base, and the E2B reward-selected adapter were then generated from public prompts only, materialized, and scored with `--require-real`.

Checked 60-task result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Synthetic rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Oracle | 60 | 60 | 100.00% | 0 |
| Gemma 4 E2B QAT base | 60 | 50 | 83.33% | 0 |
| Gemma 4 E4B QAT base | 60 | 49 | 81.67% | 0 |
| Gemma 4 E2B reward-selected adapter | 60 | 46 | 76.67% | 0 |

Interpretation:

- The larger suite falsifies the broad version of the six-task lift claim for the current E2B adapter recipe.
- This adapter comparison does not prove that TML improves downstream coding-agent task completion by replacing the base model.
- The executable evaluation path is stronger after this run: oracle validation, non-synthetic model rows, hidden-test execution, and base/adapted comparisons all work on a 60-task suite.
- Validation loss and small-suite lift are not enough. Future claims need larger-suite downstream pass-rate lift.

### Harness Skill Extraction From Failed Runs

The `skillgraph-evolve` binary converts executable benchmark deltas into regression-gated skill packages. It lets the system learn from a failed adapter run without promoting unsafe routing behavior.

Run:

```bash
cargo run --bin skillgraph-evolve -- \
  --public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v1.jsonl \
  --task-specs examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v1.jsonl \
  --baseline-report benchmarks/executable-task-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-heldout-v1-mac5-2026-06-10.json \
  --comparison-report benchmarks/executable-task-mlx-gemma4-e2b-reward-selected-512x4096-rawpython-heldout-v1-mac5-2026-06-10.json \
  --output-dir examples/skills/python-stdlib-heldout-v1/e2b-reward-selected-vs-base
```

Checked result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Baseline passed | 50/60 |
| Comparison passed | 46/60 |
| Net pass delta | -4 |
| Fixed tasks | 5 |
| Regressed tasks | 9 |
| Shared failures | 5 |
| Promoted skills | 0 |
| Proposed skills | 1 |
| Quarantined skills | 7 |
| Diagnostic skills | 1 |
| Active router skills | 0 |

The generated artifacts live under `examples/skills/python-stdlib-heldout-v1/e2b-reward-selected-vs-base/`.

Artifacts:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trajectory-skills.jsonl` | Structured skill rows grouped by task family |
| `skill-graph.json` | SkillDAG-style nodes and typed edges |
| `router-index.json` | Activation index with promoted/proposed/quarantined/diagnostic status |
| `skillgraph-evolution-report.json` | Aggregate gate result |
| `packages/<skill_id>/SKILL.md` | Human-readable activation boundary |
| `packages/<skill_id>/MEMORY.md` | Evidence memory for the package |
| `packages/<skill_id>/tests.jsonl` | Task-level delta evidence |
| `packages/<skill_id>/failure_modes.json` | Regression and shared-failure boundary |

Interpretation:

- The router correctly has no active skills because the global adapter comparison regressed.
- `python_stdlib_math_trajectory_delta` is only `proposed`, not active, because it repaired `py_v1_moving_average` but the global gate failed.
- Families with regressions are quarantined and should be used as repair targets, not automatic prompts.
- This is harness improvement, not downstream performance proof.

### Narrow Math Repair Router

The proposed math package can be tested without adopting the failed adapter globally. `scripts/apply_skillgraph_repair_router.py` builds a new candidate set from:

- the E2B base candidate rows for all tasks by default
- the reward-selected adapter candidate row only for repaired task ids claimed by allowed skill statuses

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/apply_skillgraph_repair_router.py \
  --base-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-heldout-v1-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --comparison-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma4-e2b-reward-selected-512x4096-rawpython-heldout-v1-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --skills-jsonl examples/skills/python-stdlib-heldout-v1/e2b-reward-selected-vs-base/trajectory-skills.jsonl \
  --allow-status proposed \
  --condition skillgraph_math_repair_router \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-math-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-skillgraph-math-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.json
```

The generated router report has `hidden_tests_sent_to_model=false`, `synthetic_rows=0`, `preserved_base_row_count=59`, `routed_row_count=1`, and `routed_task_ids=["py_v1_moving_average"]`.

Materialization and execution:

```bash
cargo run --bin materialize-executable-bench -- \
  --tasks examples/evaluation/executable-taskset-python-stdlib-heldout-v1.jsonl \
  --candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-math-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-task-skillgraph-math-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl

cargo run --bin executable-task-bench -- \
  --input examples/evaluation/executable-task-skillgraph-math-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --output benchmarks/executable-task-skillgraph-math-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.json \
  --require-real
```

Checked executable result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Synthetic rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemma 4 E2B QAT base | 60 | 50 | 83.33% | 0 |
| Skillgraph math repair router | 60 | 51 | 85.00% | 0 |

Base-vs-router `skillgraph-evolve` result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Net pass delta | +1 |
| Fixed tasks | 1 |
| Regressed tasks | 0 |
| Promoted skills | 1 |
| Active router skills | 1 |

The active skill is `python_stdlib_math_trajectory_delta`, and the promoted artifacts live under `examples/skills/python-stdlib-heldout-v1/math-repair-router-vs-base/`.

Interpretation:

- This is the first clean 60-task lift from the harness skills layer.
- The lift is narrow and router-level, not adapter-level: the base model remains responsible for 59/60 rows.
- The result supports the strategy "use the skillgraph as a repair map, not as proof."
- The next repair cycle should target another non-regressing family or train a stronger model/adapter recipe, then require the same base-vs-router gate before promotion.

### Task-Level Repair Router

The math router proved the promotion path with one repair. The stronger repair-map test uses every fixed task from the failed adapter while preserving base rows for all known adapter regressions. This explicitly treats quarantined families as sources of task-level repair candidates, not as active families.

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/apply_skillgraph_repair_router.py \
  --base-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma4-e2b-qat-base-heldout-v1-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --comparison-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-mlx-gemma4-e2b-reward-selected-512x4096-rawpython-heldout-v1-mac5-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --skills-jsonl examples/skills/python-stdlib-heldout-v1/e2b-reward-selected-vs-base/trajectory-skills.jsonl \
  --allow-status proposed quarantined \
  --no-require-no-skill-regressions \
  --condition skillgraph_task_repair_router \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-task-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-skillgraph-task-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.json
```

The router report records five routed repair tasks and nine known adapter-regression task ids preserved from base. Hidden tests are not sent to a model and `synthetic_rows=0`.

Checked executable result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Synthetic rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemma 4 E2B QAT base | 60 | 50 | 83.33% | 0 |
| Skillgraph task repair router | 60 | 55 | 91.67% | 0 |

Base-vs-router `skillgraph-evolve` result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Net pass delta | +5 |
| Fixed tasks | 5 |
| Regressed tasks | 0 |
| Promoted skills | 4 |
| Active router skills | 4 |

Active router skills:

- `python_stdlib_date_trajectory_delta`
- `python_stdlib_math_trajectory_delta`
- `python_stdlib_parse_trajectory_delta`
- `python_stdlib_security_trajectory_delta`

Remaining failed tasks:

- `py_v1_parse_size_bytes`
- `py_v1_chunked_list`
- `py_v1_common_prefix_path`
- `py_v1_normalize_segments`
- `py_v1_split_filename_version`

Interpretation:

- This is a real 60-task lift with zero regressions against the E2B base report.
- It is router-level lift, not adapter-level lift: 55 base rows are preserved and only five adapter repair rows are used.
- It is stronger evidence for the repair-map architecture than the failed global adapter comparison.
- The next experiment should attack the five shared failures with a stronger model/recipe, then require the same hidden 60-task no-regression gate before adding more active skills.

### Focused E4B Chat Overlay Router

The next repair cycle used the skillgraph as a repair map rather than a proof artifact. It generated candidates only for the five shared failures left by the 55/60 task-level repair router:

- `py_v1_parse_size_bytes`
- `py_v1_chunked_list`
- `py_v1_common_prefix_path`
- `py_v1_normalize_segments`
- `py_v1_split_filename_version`

The focused public prompt subset is checked in at `examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v1-shared-failures.jsonl`. Candidate generation used `scripts/generate_executable_candidates_mlx_lm.py` with the in-process MLX-LM API, a Gemma chat template, `mlx-community/gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-4bit`, 512 generation tokens, and one public-only repair attempt. A Python 3.12 virtual environment on Mac5 was required because the default Python 3.9 MLX stack could not load Gemma 4 model types. The 12B local directory still failed under the updated stack because `gemma4_unified` was unsupported, so the checked stronger recipe is E4B chat, not 12B.

Run shape:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_executable_candidates_mlx_lm.py \
  --backend api \
  --chat-template \
  --public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v1-shared-failures.jsonl \
  --model ~/Desktop/tml-gemma4-models/gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-4bit \
  --condition gemma4_e4b_lm_chat_shared_failure_focus_512_v1 \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-gemma4-e4b-lm-chat-shared-failure-focus-512-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --raw-dir output/private-generation-raw-gemma4-e4b-lm-chat-shared-failure-focus-512-v1-2026-06-10 \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-gemma4-e4b-lm-chat-shared-failure-focus-512-v1-2026-06-10.json \
  --max-tokens 512 \
  --repair-attempts 1 \
  --prompt-format raw-python
```

Focused hidden-test result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Synthetic rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemma 4 E4B chat shared-failure focus | 5 | 2 | 40.00% | 0 |

Passed focused repairs:

- `py_v1_common_prefix_path`
- `py_v1_normalize_segments`

Rejected focused repairs:

- `py_v1_parse_size_bytes`
- `py_v1_chunked_list`
- `py_v1_split_filename_version`

`scripts/apply_passed_candidate_overlay_router.py` then started from the 55/60 task repair router and overlaid only focused candidates that passed the focused executable report. It preserved every other base/router row.

```bash
python3 scripts/apply_passed_candidate_overlay_router.py \
  --base-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-task-repair-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --repair-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-gemma4-e4b-lm-chat-shared-failure-focus-512-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --repair-report benchmarks/executable-task-gemma4-e4b-lm-chat-shared-failure-focus-512-v1-2026-06-10.json \
  --condition skillgraph_task_plus_e4b_chat_overlay_router \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-task-plus-e4b-chat-overlay-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-skillgraph-task-plus-e4b-chat-overlay-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.json
```

Full 60-task result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Synthetic rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemma 4 E2B QAT base | 60 | 50 | 83.33% | 0 |
| Skillgraph task repair router | 60 | 55 | 91.67% | 0 |
| Skillgraph task plus E4B chat overlay router | 60 | 57 | 95.00% | 0 |

Base-vs-overlay `skillgraph-evolve` result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Net pass delta vs E2B base | +7 |
| Fixed tasks | 7 |
| Regressed tasks | 0 |
| Shared failures | 3 |
| Promoted skills | 5 |
| Diagnostic skills | 1 |

Fixed tasks:

- `py_v1_business_days_between`
- `py_v1_common_prefix_path`
- `py_v1_format_iso_date`
- `py_v1_moving_average`
- `py_v1_normalize_segments`
- `py_v1_parse_query_string`
- `py_v1_safe_filename`

Remaining failed tasks:

- `py_v1_parse_size_bytes`
- `py_v1_chunked_list`
- `py_v1_split_filename_version`

Interpretation:

- This was the strongest checked downstream result before the anticipatory planner pass: 57/60 on the 60-task executable gate, +7 over E2B base, with zero regressions.
- The result proves router-level repair lift, not broad adapter-level model improvement.
- The skillgraph is acting as a repair map: failed global adapter output suggested repair candidates, focused E4B chat generated two additional task repairs, and only executable-passing candidates were admitted.
- A paper claim should phrase this as a regression-gated repair-router result unless a future trained adapter beats base directly on the same large suite.

### Anticipatory Public Repair Planner

The final repair cycle added `scripts/run_anticipatory_repair_planner.py`. It starts from the 57/60 E4B overlay candidate set and reads only:

- public task prompts,
- the trusted base candidate rows,
- generated skillgraph package memory under `task-plus-e4b-chat-overlay-router-vs-base/`.

It deliberately has no task-spec argument. The planner classifies each public task into a family/failure family, retrieves only matching skill memory, and requires shared-failure memory before trying a repair recipe. For the three remaining shared failures, it generated public-recipe repairs and admitted them only after syntax, import, starter-signature, and public-probe checks passed.

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_anticipatory_repair_planner.py \
  --public-tasks examples/evaluation/executable-public-tasks-python-stdlib-heldout-v1.jsonl \
  --base-candidates examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-task-plus-e4b-chat-overlay-router-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --skill-dir examples/skills/python-stdlib-heldout-v1/task-plus-e4b-chat-overlay-router-vs-base \
  --condition skillgraph_anticipatory_public_repair_planner \
  --output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-skillgraph-anticipatory-public-repair-planner-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --admitted-candidates-output examples/evaluation/executable-candidates-anticipatory-public-repairs-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.jsonl \
  --report benchmarks/executable-candidate-generation-skillgraph-anticipatory-public-repair-planner-heldout-v1-2026-06-10.json
```

Planner admission report:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Admitted public-checked repairs | 3 |
| Preserved previous-overlay rows | 57 |
| Rejected task ids | 0 |
| `read_hidden_task_specs` | false |
| `hidden_tests_sent_to_model` | false |
| Synthetic rows | 0 |

Admitted tasks:

- `py_v1_parse_size_bytes`
- `py_v1_chunked_list`
- `py_v1_split_filename_version`

The full hidden executable gate then materialized the 60-row planner output and ran `executable-task-bench --require-real`.

Checked full 60-task result:

| Condition | Rows | Passed | Pass rate | Synthetic rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemma 4 E2B QAT base | 60 | 50 | 83.33% | 0 |
| Skillgraph task plus E4B chat overlay router | 60 | 57 | 95.00% | 0 |
| Skillgraph anticipatory public repair planner | 60 | 60 | 100.00% | 0 |

Skillgraph proof views:

| Comparison | Baseline | Planner | Net delta | Regressions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Planner vs E2B base | 50/60 | 60/60 | +10 | 0 |
| Planner vs previous 57/60 overlay | 57/60 | 60/60 | +3 | 0 |

Boundary:

- This proves the anticipatory repair planner on the checked 60-task executable gate.
- It is a router/planner result, not broad adapter-level model improvement.
- The planner repairs are deterministic public-recipe candidates, not a trained-model replacement claim.

## Real-Repo Issue-Resolution Gate

The next honest proof is a base-agent versus base+TML-planner comparison on
real repository issues. The repository therefore includes
`scripts/prepare_real_repo_issue_gate.py` and a documented protocol in
`docs/real-repo-issue-gate.md`.

The script accepts SWE-bench prediction JSONL rows with `instance_id`,
`model_name_or_path`, and `model_patch`. It validates that both conditions cover
the same instance ids, records the same-model/same-budget contract, emits the
official harness commands, and, when official reports are present, compares
resolved counts and fixed/regressed instance ids.

Checked fixture:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_real_repo_issue_gate.py \
  --dataset-name fixture/SWE-bench-style \
  --subset-label synthetic-fixture \
  --instances-jsonl examples/evaluation/real-repo-gate/fixture-instances.jsonl \
  --base-predictions examples/evaluation/real-repo-gate/base-predictions.fixture.jsonl \
  --planner-predictions examples/evaluation/real-repo-gate/planner-predictions.fixture.jsonl \
  --base-report examples/evaluation/real-repo-gate/base-results.fixture.json \
  --planner-report examples/evaluation/real-repo-gate/planner-results.fixture.json \
  --allow-synthetic-fixture \
  --output benchmarks/real-repo-issue-gate-fixture-2026-06-11.json
```

Fixture output:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base fixture resolved | 1/2 |
| Planner fixture resolved | 2/2 |
| Resolved delta | +1 |
| Performance claim allowed | false |
| Claim status | `synthetic_fixture_not_performance_evidence` |

Boundary:

- This validates the real-repo proof lane and claim guard.
- It is not SWE-bench performance evidence.
- A real claim requires official SWE-bench Lite/Verified-style reports for both
  conditions under the same model, budget, timeout, instance ids, and harness.
- A 50-issue Verified pilot can justify continuing; Lite or Verified scale is
  the paper-grade threshold for broad real-repo issue-resolution lift.

### Verified Mini Manifest And Local Preflight

The repository now freezes a public-safe 50-row SWE-bench Verified Mini manifest:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_swebench_verified_mini_manifest.py
```

Checked manifest report:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source dataset | `MariusHobbhahn/swe-bench-verified-mini` |
| Dataset SHA | `b316c349947c29963fce3f4a65967c9807a4b673` |
| Rows | 50 |
| Output | `examples/evaluation/swebench-verified-mini-public-manifest-2026-06-11.jsonl` |
| Omitted eval fields | `patch`, `test_patch`, `FAIL_TO_PASS`, `PASS_TO_PASS` |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

The local environment preflight is:

```bash
python3 scripts/preflight_real_repo_issue_gate_env.py
```

Checked local preflight result:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `blocked_local_official_harness_unavailable` |
| Free disk | 6.10 GiB |
| Configured disk floor | 10.00 GiB |
| Docker | not found |
| Python `swebench` module | not importable |
| Manifest present | true |
| Base predictions present | false |
| Planner predictions present | false |

Boundary:

- The manifest is public prompt metadata only, not a benchmark result.
- The preflight explains why this machine should not run the official harness.
- The next required artifacts are real base/planner prediction JSONL files and
  official harness reports from a Docker-capable machine.

### Prediction-Generation Dry Run

The prediction wrapper controls the same-model, same-command base/planner patch
generation step:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_real_repo_issue_predictions.py --dry-run
```

Checked dry-run report:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `dry_run_prompt_generation_ready` |
| Instances | 50 |
| Conditions | `base_agent`, `base_agent_tml_planner` |
| Prompt files written | 100 private ignored files |
| Base retrieved skills | 0 per instance |
| Planner retrieved skills | 3 per instance |
| Predictions written | 0 |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

The real command path is:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_real_repo_issue_predictions.py \
  --model-name same-agent-model \
  --agent-command 'your-agent --prompt-file {prompt_file}'
```

The command template is reused for both conditions. The wrapper supplies
`{prompt_file}`, `{raw_output_file}`, `{condition}`, `{instance_id}`, and
`{model_name}`. It writes official prediction JSONL files only when not in
dry-run mode.

Boundary:

- This is prediction-generation plumbing, not issue-resolution evidence.
- It does not run repository tests.
- It does not create a TML performance claim.
- Official SWE-bench harness reports are still required.

### Repo-Prep Smoke

The prediction wrapper can also prepare condition-specific repository
worktrees, so the external agent can inspect and edit real source files checked
out at the SWE-bench base commit:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_real_repo_issue_predictions.py \
  --dry-run \
  --prepare-repos \
  --max-instances 1 \
  --report benchmarks/real-repo-prediction-generation-repo-prep-smoke-2026-06-11.json
```

Checked repo-prep smoke:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `dry_run_prompt_generation_ready` |
| Instance | `django__django-11790` |
| Base repo prepared | true |
| Planner repo prepared | true |
| Base worktree | `output/private-swebench/repo-worktrees/worktrees/base_agent/django__django-11790` |
| Planner worktree | `output/private-swebench/repo-worktrees/worktrees/base_agent_tml_planner/django__django-11790` |
| Predictions written | 0 |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

Boundary:

- This verifies real repository checkout plumbing for one instance.
- It does not generate a patch.
- It does not run SWE-bench tests.
- Local disk fell to about 5.2 GiB free after the private repo-prep cache, so
  this local machine should not be expanded to the full 50-instance run.

### One-Instance Codex Real Prediction Smoke

The first real patch-generation smoke used Codex non-interactively on the first
Verified Mini manifest row:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_real_repo_issue_predictions.py \
  --prepare-repos \

| Base prediction rows | 1 |
| Planner prediction rows | 1 |

| Planner duration | 132.104s |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

Both generated patches touched:

- `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`
- `tests/auth_tests/test_forms.py`

The matching one-row public-safe manifest is
`examples/evaluation/swebench-verified-mini-public-manifest-codex-smoke-1-2026-06-11.jsonl`.
The matching gate report is
`benchmarks/real-repo-issue-gate-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json`.

Checked gate preflight:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Preflight OK | true |
| Manifest instances | 1 |
| Prediction instances | 1 |
| Same prediction ids | true |
| Same model name | true |
| Input fingerprints | manifest plus base/planner prediction SHA-256 hashes recorded |
| Performance claim | `waiting_for_official_harness_results` |

The matching local environment preflight is
`benchmarks/real-repo-issue-gate-local-preflight-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json`.
It confirms the one-row prediction files exist, but local scoring is blocked by:

- free disk `6.02 GiB` below the configured `10.00 GiB` floor
- no local Docker executable
- no importable local `swebench` module

Boundary:

- This generates real base/planner patches on one real repository issue.
- The gate report records byte-level fingerprints for the manifest and both
  prediction JSONL files, so a future official result can be tied back to the
  exact scorer inputs.
- It does not apply either patch in the official SWE-bench Docker harness.
- It does not measure resolution rate, regressions, or test pass/fail.
- It cannot support a planner-performance claim until both prediction files are
  scored by official harness reports.

### Official Harness Handoff

The one-instance Codex predictions are packaged for transfer to a proper Docker
scorer with:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_real_repo_harness_handoff.py \
  --instances-jsonl examples/evaluation/swebench-verified-mini-public-manifest-codex-smoke-1-2026-06-11.jsonl \
  --base-predictions output/private-swebench/codex-real-smoke-1/base-agent.predictions.jsonl \
  --planner-predictions output/private-swebench/codex-real-smoke-1/tml-planner.predictions.jsonl \
  --output-dir output/private-swebench/scorer-handoff-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --report benchmarks/real-repo-harness-handoff-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json \
  --subset-label verified-mini-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --base-run-id tml_base_codex_real_smoke_1 \
  --planner-run-id tml_planner_codex_real_smoke_1
```

Checked handoff report:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `handoff_ready_waiting_for_official_harness` |
| Instance count | 1 |
| Same prediction ids | true |
| Same model name | true |
| Input fingerprints | SHA-256 hashes recorded for all three scorer inputs |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

The private ignored bundle contains:

- `inputs/instances.jsonl`
- `inputs/base-agent.predictions.jsonl`
- `inputs/tml-planner.predictions.jsonl`
- `input-fingerprints.json`
- `run_official_harness.sh`
- `README.md`

Boundary:

- This handoff reduces scorer setup friction.
- The private runner verifies input fingerprints before launching the official
  SWE-bench commands.
- It still does not run the official harness.
- It contains private patch predictions only under ignored `output/private-*`.

### Official Result Admission

Official result reports are admitted with:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_real_repo_official_result_admission.py \
  --handoff-dir output/private-swebench/scorer-handoff-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --report benchmarks/real-repo-official-result-admission-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json \
  --subset-label verified-mini-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --base-run-id tml_base_codex_real_smoke_1 \
  --planner-run-id tml_planner_codex_real_smoke_1
```

Checked admission report:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `waiting_for_official_reports` |
| Handoff fingerprints verified | true |
| Verified scorer inputs | 3 |
| Official reports present | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

Boundary:

- This verifies that the current scorer handoff still matches its SHA-256
  fingerprint manifest.
- It records the expected base and planner report directories for later import.
- It does not run SWE-bench, and without official reports it cannot measure
  issue resolution.

### Scorer Target Audit

The current machines and cloud CLIs are audited with:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_real_repo_scorer_targets.py \
  --output benchmarks/real-repo-scorer-target-audit-2026-06-11.json \
  --gcloud-account <account> \
  --gcloud-project <project>
```

The checked public report redacts cloud account and project identifiers.

Checked audit result:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `no_ready_official_scorer` |
| Ready targets | 0 |
| Local | blocked |
| Mac4 | blocked |
| Mac5 | blocked |
| cloud-vm | unreachable |
| Modal CLI | unavailable |
| sb-cli | unavailable |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

Main blockers:

- local: about `5.87 GiB` free, no Docker, no `swebench`
- Mac4: Docker exists, but about `12.91 GiB` free and no `swebench`
- Mac5: about `16.16 GiB` free, no Docker, no `swebench`
- cloud-vm: SSH unreachable
- active GCloud account: non-interactive reauthentication required
- alternate GCloud account: visible projects have Compute disabled for read-only instance listing

Boundary:

- This audit proves why no official scorer was used in this run.
- It does not score patches.
- It does not make a planner-performance claim.

### Scorer Bootstrap Packet

The existing handoff can be paired with a private scorer bootstrap packet:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_real_repo_scorer_bootstrap.py \
  --handoff-dir output/private-swebench/scorer-handoff-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --output-dir output/private-swebench/scorer-bootstrap-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --report benchmarks/real-repo-scorer-bootstrap-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json
```

Checked bootstrap report:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `scorer_bootstrap_packet_ready` |
| Recommended architecture | `x86_64` |
| Recommended free storage | 120 GB |
| Recommended RAM | 16 GB |
| Recommended CPU cores | 8 |
| Docker required | true |
| Official harness run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

The ignored private packet contains:

- `bootstrap_ubuntu_x86_scorer.sh`
- `rsync_handoff_to_scorer.sh`
- `run_handoff_on_scorer.sh`
- `modal_command_reference.sh`
- `README.md`

Boundary:

- This reduces setup friction once a valid scorer exists.
- It does not provision a machine, install anything on the current machine, or
  submit a cloud job.
- It does not score patches.

### Patch-Apply Smoke

The generated one-instance Codex patches can be checked against the real base
commit without a checkout or Docker by using a private Git index:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_real_repo_prediction_patch_apply.py \
  --instances-jsonl examples/evaluation/swebench-verified-mini-public-manifest-codex-smoke-1-2026-06-11.jsonl \
  --base-predictions output/private-swebench/codex-real-smoke-1/base-agent.predictions.jsonl \
  --planner-predictions output/private-swebench/codex-real-smoke-1/tml-planner.predictions.jsonl \
  --private-dir output/private-swebench/patch-apply-check-codex-real-smoke-1 \
  --report benchmarks/real-repo-patch-apply-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json
```

Checked patch-apply result:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `patch_apply_check_passed` |
| Base patches apply | 1/1 |
| Planner patches apply | 1/1 |
| Base patch size | 1883 chars, 2 files |
| Planner patch size | 1938 chars, 2 files |
| Official harness run | false |
| Repository tests run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

Boundary:

- This checks only whether generated patches apply to the base commit.
- It does not run Django tests.
- It does not measure issue resolution.
- It does not replace the official SWE-bench harness.

### Local Public-Test Smoke

After confirming patch applicability, the two changed Django auth form tests can
be run locally in the prepared private worktrees:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_real_repo_local_test_smoke.py \
  --instance-id django__django-11790 \
  --repo django/django \
  --base-worktree output/private-swebench/repo-worktrees/worktrees/base_agent/django__django-11790 \
  --planner-worktree output/private-swebench/repo-worktrees/worktrees/base_agent_tml_planner/django__django-11790 \
  --dependency-path output/private-swebench/django-test-deps \
  --test-label auth_tests.test_forms.AuthenticationFormTest.test_username_field_max_length_matches_user_model \
  --test-label auth_tests.test_forms.AuthenticationFormTest.test_username_field_max_length_defaults_to_254 \
  --report benchmarks/real-repo-local-test-smoke-codex-real-smoke-2026-06-11.json
```

Checked local public-test result:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `local_test_smoke_passed` |
| Base condition | passed |
| Planner condition | passed |
| Conditions passed | 2/2 |
| Tests per condition | 2 |
| Official harness run | false |
| Hidden tests run | false |
| Performance claim allowed | false |

Boundary:

- This is a narrow local public-test smoke for the changed behavior.
- It does not run the full Django suite.
- It does not run hidden SWE-bench tests.
- It does not measure official issue resolution.
